Streamlit is not great at interactivity. Same button for refresh and submit 
and I'll deal with any horrible data that crops up.

Tempted to try a form of confident learning where I only accept images the 
model is already confident on to retrain. This will enable a gradual evolution
of the training set but will probably fall over on significantly different doodles.

e.g. a car drawn from head on or similar.
